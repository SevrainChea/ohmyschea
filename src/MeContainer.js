      Hi there, my name is Sevrain CHEA and I am a software engineer (mostly
      back-end). I am passionate about my work and I love learning about new
      technologies 🤖.
      <p>
        I am still at an early stage in my career, but I plan on always
        improving my skills and on working on several different technologies. I
        am currently comfortable with Java(Spring, SpringBoot) and
        JavaScript(ReactJS) and I aim on learning and working in Python, NodeJs
        and GraphQL 🧠.
      </p>
      <p>
        During my spare time, I like playing video games, cooking and coding. I
        am an NBA fan and I love discovering new cultures by travelling and
        tasting new food 🍛.
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      I am always eager to takle new challenges so if you are interested in my
      profile, feel free to contact me 😀!
